==================== FINAL CONCLUSION ====================

  [VERDICT: The 55.51% is a REAL SIGNAL]
  The 'Path of Least Resistance' is a real phenomenon.
  This neutral engine, with no S_n data, achieved 22.20% accuracy,
  which is significantly higher than the 10.00% random baseline.
  This proves the 55.51% was not a tautology, but the result of
  a highly-tuned engine correctly identifying a real primorial bias.
