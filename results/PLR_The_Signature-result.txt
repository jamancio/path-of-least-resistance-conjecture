==================== FINAL CONCLUSION ====================

  [VERDICT: SUCCESS. THE 'FAILURE SIGNATURE' IS REAL!]
  The new 'v12.0' engine's accuracy (68.07%) has
  broken the 60.49% barrier!

  This PROVES the final hypothesis:
  The 39.51% of failures are not random noise, but a
  predictable 'Clean #1 vs. Messy #2' signature that
  can be identified and corrected.
