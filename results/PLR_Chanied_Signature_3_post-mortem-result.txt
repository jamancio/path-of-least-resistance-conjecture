# PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE (PLR) - TEST 30: v16.0 Gap Signature Analysis
#
# This is the final post-mortem on our 75.94% champion v16.0 engine.
#
# We are testing the "Gap Signature" hypothesis:
# Are the remaining 24.06% of failures correlated with the
# relationship between the *previous* gap (g_{n-1}) and the
# *current* gap (g_n)?
#
# This script will run the v16.0 engine and, for every failure,
# it will log the failure in a 2D matrix:
#
#          | g_n (Small) | g_n (Medium) | g_n (Large)
# g_{n-1} (Small) | ...         | ...          | ...
# g_{n-1} (Medium)| ...         | ...          | ...
# g_{n-1} (Large) | ...         | ...          | ...
#
# A non-uniform distribution (e.g., a huge number in the
# "Small_to_Large" bin) will prove the existence of
# a new, solvable "Gap Signature".

==================== FINAL ANALYTIC CONCLUSION ====================

  We are looking for a 'hot corner' in the matrix.

  [VERDICT: 'GAP SIGNATURE' DISCOVERED!]
  A massive 31.55% of all failures
  are concentrated in the 'Small_to_Large' gap signature.
  This is a new, solvable, non-linear signal.
  It proves failures are predictable based on gap volatility.
