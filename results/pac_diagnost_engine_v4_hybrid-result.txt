  v4.0 Hybrid Engine:       10.97% (Mod 6 + Mod 210 Tie-Breaker)

  Improvement over Baseline:  -44.54 percentage points


==================== FINAL CONCLUSION ====================

  [VERDICT: NO IMPROVEMENT. v_mod6 REMAINS CHAMPION]
  The v4.0 engine's accuracy (10.97%) is not better than
  the v_mod6 baseline (55.51%).
  The 'Mod 210' tie-breaker did not add predictive power,
  implying the 'Mod 6' signal is truly the only one that matters.
