==================== FINAL CONCLUSION ====================

  [VERDICT: SUCCESS. 'HIDDEN VARIABLE' SOLVED]
  The new 'Two-Mode' engine is a stronger predictor!
  This is a new accuracy record: 64.14%
  This proves the 44.49% of failures were caused by a 'mode switch'
  to a Mod 30 signal, which this engine correctly models.
