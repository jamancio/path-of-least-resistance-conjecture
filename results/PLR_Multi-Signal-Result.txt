==================== PLR (v9.0 'Multi-Signal' Corrected) TEST REPORT ====================

Total Primes Tested (p_n): 50,000,000
Candidates Checked per Prime: 10

Total Correct (v7.0 Corrected Baseline): 7,774,011
Total Correct (v9.0 New):                9,285,933

  v7.0 'Recursive' (Corrected Baseline): 15.55%
  v9.0 'Multi-Signal' (New):           18.57%
  ---------------------------------
  Improvement over Corrected Baseline: +3.02 percentage points


==================== FINAL CONCLUSION ====================

  This is the definitive 'apples-to-apples' test.
  Note that the v7.0 baseline accuracy itself may have changed
  now that it's using corrected v1.0 data.

  [VERDICT: SUCCESS. 'MULTI-SIGNAL' IS SUPERIOR]
  The new 'Multi-Signal' engine is the strongest predictor yet!
  This is a new accuracy record: 18.57%
  This proves that the v7.0 engine's 'blind spot' (Mode 2)
  was the key. By adding the normalized v_mod30 signal as a
  tie-breaker, the engine can now 'see' k=25 failures and avoid them.
