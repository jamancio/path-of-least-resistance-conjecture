Candidates Checked per Prime: 10

Total Correct Predictions (v7.0 Static): 28,918,101
Total Correct Predictions (v8.0 Consensus): 26,768,952

  Random Chance Accuracy:     10.00%
  v7.0 'Recursive' (Baseline): 57.84% (Static p_n viewpoint)
  v8.0 'Consensus' (New):    53.54% (p_n-1, p_n, p_n+1 viewpoints)
  ---------------------------------
  Improvement over Baseline: -4.30 percentage points


==================== FINAL CONCLUSION ====================

  [VERDICT: NO IMPROVEMENT. v7.0 REMAINS CHAMPION]
  The new 'Consensus' engine's accuracy (53.54%) is not
  better than the v7.0 baseline (57.84%).
  This implies the 'noise' is consistent across the
  local neighborhood, or this voting model is not
  the correct way to harness the Law III methodology.
