  v7.0 'Recursive' (Corrected Baseline): 15.55%
  v10.0 'Gap Tie-Breaker' (New):       55.51%
  ---------------------------------
  Improvement over Corrected Baseline: +39.96 percentage points


==================== FINAL CONCLUSION ====================

  [VERDICT: SUCCESS. THE TRUE SIGNAL IS FOUND.]
  The new 'v10.0' engine's accuracy (55.51%) restores
  the high accuracy from the 'buggy' v7.0 test.

  This PROVES two things:
  1. The 57.84% signal was REAL, but it was *this* engine.
  2. The 'Recursive' (v_mod30/210) logic was ALWAYS noise.

  The true 'Path of Least Resistance' is the
  `v_mod6` filter, tie-broken by the `prime_gap`.
